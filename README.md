# MIVE
This is the repository for a final year project made by me and a few others. It is a attempt at an Immersive Virtual Reality Environment. You start out in the main hub which is a large custom built terrain with currently just a small road and a portal which takes you to a XR Toolkit Starter Room which is currently kept just as a placeholder.

Rooms planned include a Conference Room, a Classroom and a Theatre.

Made with Unity 2021.3.18f1 along with XR Interaction Toolkit 2.3.0-pre.1
